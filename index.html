          <ul>
            <li>Life has different definition in the eyes of different people. There is no a clear cut definition for it. For some, life is all about building a family and leading "life" as it is. For some, life is all about accumulating wealth. For others ,life is all about engaging in academic circle. Still for others, life is all about art. For many life is all about love. For a few, life is all about religious practices. For philosopher like Aristotle life is about happiness: "Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life, the whole aim and end of human existence." Hence life has different definition for different people.</li>
            <br>
            <li>To me, life is inherently meaningless. That does not mean there is no meaning to life â€” just that it's not intrinsic. It can change, develop, and grow over time.</li>
